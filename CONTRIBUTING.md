# Contributing to @iamsuperdev/typeful

Thank you for your interest in contributing to typeful! We welcome contributions from the community to help make this type-safe database query library even better.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun runtime (latest version recommended)
- PostgreSQL database (for testing and development)
- TypeScript 5.8.2 or higher

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/typeful.git
cd typeful
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
```

4. Build the project to verify your setup:

```bash
bun run build
```

## Development Workflow

### Project Structure

```
src/              # Source TypeScript files
  - generate.ts   # Type generation logic
  - db.ts         # Database connection utilities
  - build.ts      # Build utilities
  - types.ts      # Type definitions
  - utils.ts      # Utility functions
  - index.ts      # Main entry point
  - run-generate.ts # CLI for type generation
dist/             # Built JavaScript files (generated)
```

### Available Scripts

- `bun run build` - Build TypeScript and minify output
- `bun run uglify` - Minify JavaScript files in dist/
- `bun run lint` - Run ESLint on the codebase
- `bun run lint:fix` - Fix linting issues automatically
- `bun run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `bun run format:check` - Check code formatting
- `bun x generate` - Generate types from database schema (via bin command)

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes in the `src/` directory

3. Test your changes:
   - Ensure type generation works correctly with `bun x generate`
   - Run linting with `bun run lint`
   - Check formatting with `bun run format:check`

4. Build and lint the project:

```bash
bun run build
bun run lint
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Avoid using `any` types
- Provide proper type annotations for function parameters and return values
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for types and interfaces
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose

### Code Organization

- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into utility functions
- Maintain clear separation between type generation and runtime code

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Currently no test suite is configured
# Tests can be added in the future
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure tests cover both success and error cases
- Test type generation with various database schemas
- Verify generated types are correct and complete

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines
2. Update documentation if you've changed APIs or added features
3. Add or update tests as appropriate
4. Ensure all tests pass and the build succeeds
5. Update the README.md if needed
