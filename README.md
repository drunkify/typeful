# Full-stack type safety ORM

## Why?

The idea is to create a robust solution that helps maintain consistency from the database level to the frontend application. Tiny changes in the database structure will affect the whole application. **Say goodbye to "any".**

## Core Benefits

**End-to-End Type Safety**

- Database schema drives all types
- Compile-time error detection for database changes
- No runtime surprises from schema mismatches

**Developer Experience**

- Full IDE autocompletion for all queries and responses
- Auto-generated types from database schema
- Instant feedback on breaking changes

**Simplified Architecture**

- Just one API endpoint needed
- Reduced boilerplate code
- No duplicate type definitions

## How?

**There are two steps:**

- Generate types
- Reuse types on the backend and frontend with special type utilities and tools, which are **all provided by this library**

## Usage

Let's say we have the following monorepo folder structure:

```
apps/
  frontend/
  backend/
common/
  ui/
package.json
.env
```

Install the package:

```bash
pnpm i -D @iamsuperdev/typeful
```

Add `DATABASE_URL` to the `.env` file (only PostgreSQL is available at this moment).
It assumes the database has an existing data structure and schema.

Generate types:

```bash
pnpm generate common
```

Then in the common folder, a new folder named "generated" will appear.

Updated folder structure:

```
apps/
  frontend/
  backend/
common/
  generated/
  ui/
package.json
.env
```

Create a **single endpoint** on the backend:

```js
// Import the performQuery function
import { performQuery } from '@iamsuperdev/typeful'

serve({
  routes: {
    '/api': async (req) => {
      const data = await performQuery(req.body.query)
      return { data }
    },
  },
})
```

That's it for the backend! ðŸŽ‰

Now let's create a users service on the frontend.

```js
import type { Tables } from "@repo/generated/tables";
import type { QueryInstance, DTO } from "@iamsuperdev/typeful";

// Create function for building query, which accepts userId parameter
function findUserById({ userId }) {
  return {
      tables: {
          users: {
              select: ['id', 'email'],
              where: { id: { eq: userId } },
              join: {
                  users_organizations: {
                      select: ['id', 'organization_id'],
                      where: { organization_id: { eq: 1 } },
                      join: {
                          organizations: {
                              select: ['id', 'name']
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  } satisfies QueryInstance<Tables>
}

// Create DTO based on the query and generated from database tables
export type UsersQueryDTO = DTO<Tables, typeof findUserById>;

// Build query and Fetch data
const query = findUserById({ userId: 1 });
fetch('https://api.example.com/api',
    { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ query }) })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then((result: usersQueryDTO) => {
        result.users.forEach(user => {
            console.log("Users email:", user.email)
        })
    })
```

Thanks to the DTO type helper, developers get full autocompletion and static type checking.

You'll see that it's not possible to make mistakes, because the query must satisfy the database schema due to generated types and the special `QueryInstance` type.

The backend receives the query and converts it to a SQL query like this. You won't need to deal with it â€” it happens under the hood automatically.

```sql
WITH users AS (
    SELECT
        users.id,
        users.email
    FROM users
    WHERE users.id = 1
)
SELECT
    users.id AS users__id,
    users.email AS users__email,
    users_organizations.id AS users_organizations__id,
    users_organizations.organization_id AS users_organizations__organization_id,
    organizations.id AS organizations__id,
    organizations.name AS organizations__name
FROM users
LEFT JOIN users_organizations
    ON users_organizations.user_id = users.id
    AND users_organizations.organization_id = 1
LEFT JOIN organizations
    ON users_organizations.organization_id = organizations.id
WHERE users.id IN (SELECT id FROM users)
```

The backend returns the following JSON with hierarchically organized data.

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "users_organizations": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "organization_id": 1,
          "organizations": [
            {
              "id": 1,
              "name": "Default"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Caveats

Use naming conventions as shown in the example. Always add "id" and foreign key "id" columns to the select array.

Add the generate script before the TypeScript transpiler, and no one can break the code with type mismatches!
